  <p>This isn’t just a donation page. It’s a quiet comeback.</p>
  <p>I’m someone who once had enough—and then didn’t. Life flipped. Bills mounted. Pride kept me silent. But I’ve learned that dignity doesn’t mean doing it alone. It means asking with honesty, giving with purpose, and building something better together.</p>
  <p>So I created this page—not to beg, but to build.</p>

  <h3>💬 Why “Just a Dollar”?</h3>
  <p>Because I know what it’s like to feel invisible. And I know how powerful one dollar can be when it’s given with intention. This isn’t about pity. It’s about proof: that small acts, multiplied, can restore hope and rewrite futures.</p>
  <p>Your dollar helps me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cover urgent personal relief (food, utilities, basic stability)</li>
    <li>Support retired family members who gave everything and now need help</li>
    <li>Build a transparent, purpose-driven platform that others can use too</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔍 What Makes This Different?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No guilt. No pressure.</strong> Just a simple ask, and a clear log of every donation.</li>
    <li><strong>Publicly visible donation log</strong> via Google Forms—so you see what’s given, when, and how it adds up.</li>
    <li><strong>Legally compliant
