  <h1>The Journey Behind the Dollar</h1>

  <p>I didn’t plan to build a donation site. I planned to rebuild my life.</p>

  <p>After years of trying to make ends meet- seeking online jobs, launching affiliate sites, accessing debt consolidation loans, getting a bank loan of any type ,even the notorious loan sharks refused give me a loan because I am a retiree and am too old to service a loan,—I hit a wall. In addition to this, the fact that I am presently the victim of a scam, and I am too afraid to take the perprtrators to court has compounded my distress.I have resorted to begging and beseaching them to return my money, which is over $4500.00, but even after two years of trying, I am still only getting promises. It feels like I am slipping down a spiral of debt and despair.</p>

  <p>So I started *Justadolla*—not as charity, but as a transparent, purpose-driven experiment. A way to raise $13,000 to restart, support others, and prove that dignity doesn’t need a big budget. Just a dollar. From enough people who care.</p>

  <p>Every dollar helps:
    <ul>
      <li>🧓 Retirees eat, heal, and feel seen</li>
      <li>🛠️ I rebuild tools, storage, and logistics</li>
      <li>📢 We grow a platform that shares real ideas for real people</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>This site logs every donation publicly. No fluff. No middlemen. Just radical transparency and a belief that small actions can spark big comebacks.</p>

  <p>If you’ve ever felt stuck, overlooked, or like your story didn’t matter—this is for you too. Let’s build something honest. Something useful. Something that proves a dollar still matters.</p>
