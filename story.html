  <h1>Story Behind the Dolla</h1>
  <p>This is my comeback story. I launched Justadolla to raise $13,000 for retiree support, logistics, and a fresh start. Every dollar helps restore dignity, rebuild tools, and grow a platform that empowers others.</p>
  <p>It’s not charity—it’s a transparent, purpose-driven experiment. You can follow every donation in the public log. I’m building this with love, grit, and full transparency.</p>
