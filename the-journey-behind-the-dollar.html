  <h1>The Journey Behind the Dollar</h1>
  <p>I didn’t launch this page as a polished campaign or a viral stunt. I launched it because I had to.</p>
  <p>After facing personal misfortune and financial setbacks, I found myself in a place where traditional opportunities—loans, grants, even steady work—were out of reach. Not because I lacked ideas or drive, but because the system isn’t built for people trying to rebuild from scratch.</p>
  <p>So I started this experiment: a simple, transparent way to ask for help without shame. Just a dollar. Not as charity, but as a vote of confidence. A way to say, “I believe in your comeback.”</p>
  <p>This isn’t just about me. It’s about retirees who’ve given everything and now face quiet struggles. It’s about people with potential who just need a bridge back to viability. It’s about proving that small acts, multiplied, can restore dignity and momentum.</p>
  <p>Every dollar logged here helps me move forward—and helps build a support system for others like me. No hype. No middlemen. Just purpose.</p>
